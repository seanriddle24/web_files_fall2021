    <h2> History </h2>
    <p> Windfall Island was founded after the Great Flood destroyed the ancient kingdom of Hyrule. Citizens from Kakariko Village and Hyrule Castle Town </p>
    <p> relocated to the mountains when their homes were swept away. There, they founded the township of Windfall, which grew to be a hub of activity much like </p>
    <p> its Hyrulean predecessors. The notable windmill in the center of town is a holdover from old Kakariko, a reminder of Windfall's storied history. </p>

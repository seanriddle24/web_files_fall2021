<h2> goals! </h2>

  <div id="goals">
    <p> well, i'd like to learn something new! i don't really know much about web design in general, so
    it'll be nice to develop a deeper understanding of a medium we all use a lot. i'd like to be able to
    use the full potential of web as a medium for more creative stuff, since i'm more of an artist than i am an engineer. plus, i'm hoping
    to do generally well in this class, academically speaking. really, i just want to have a good time! </p>
